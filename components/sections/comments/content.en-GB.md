# Comments and questions

If you enjoyed this book, or you simply found it useful for something you were trying to get done, and you were wondering how to let me know you appreciated this book, you can always [buy me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=QPRDLNGDANJSW), however much a coffee is where you live. This work has grown over the years, from a small primer to a 70ish print-page-equivalent reader on the subject of BÃ©zier curves, and a lot of coffee went into the making of it. I don't regret a minute I spent on writing it, but I can always do with some more coffee to keep on writing!
