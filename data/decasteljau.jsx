        <p>If we want to draw BÃ©zier curves we can run through all values of <i>t</i> from 0 to 1 and then
        compute the weighted basis function, getting the <i>x</i>/<i>y</i> values we need to plot, but the
        more complex the curve gets, the more expensive this becomes. Instead, we can use "de Casteljau's
        algorithm" to draw curves, which is a geometric approach to drawing curves, and really easy to
        implement. So easy, in fact, you can do it by hand with a pencil and ruler.</p>

        <p>Rather than using our calculus function to find <i>x</i>/<i>y</i> values for <i>t</i>, let's
        do this instead:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>treat <i>t</i> as a ratio (which it is). t=0 is 0% along a line, t=1 is 100% along a line.</li>
          <li>Take all lines between the curve's defining points. For an order <i>n</i> curve, that's <i>n</i> lines.</li>
          <li>Place markers along each of these line, at distance <i>t</i>. So if <i>t</i> is 0.2, place the mark
              at 20% from the start, 80% from the end.</li>
          <li>Now form lines between <i>those</i> points. This gives <i>n-1</i> lines.</li>
          <li>Place markers along each of these line at distance <i>t</i>.</li>
          <li>Form lines between <i>those</i> points. This'll be <i>n-2</i> lines.</li>
          <li>place markers, form lines, place markers, etc.</li>
          <li>repeat this until you have only one line left. The point <i>t</i> on that line coincides with the
              original curve point at <i>t</i>.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>How to implement de Casteljau's algorithm</h3>

          <p>Let's just use the algorithm we just specified, and implement that:</p>

<pre>function drawCurve(points[], t):
  if(points.length==1):
    draw(points[0])
  else:
    newpoints=array(points.size-1)
    for(i=0; i&lt;newpoints.length; i++):
      newpoints[i] = (1-t) * points[i] + t * points[i+1]
    drawCurve(newpoints, t)</pre>

          <p>And done, that's the algorithm implemented. Except usually you don't get the luxury of
          overloading the "+" operator, so let's also give the code for when you need to work with
          <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values:</p>

<pre>function drawCurve(points[], t):
  if(points.length==1):
    draw(points[0])
  else:
    newpoints=array(points.size-1)
    for(i=0; i&lt;newpoints.length; i++):
      x = (1-t) * points[i].x + t * points[i+1].x
      y = (1-t) * points[i].y + t * points[i+1].y
      newpoints[i] = new point(x,y)
    drawCurve(newpoints, t)</pre>

          <p>So what does this do? This draws a point, if the passed list of points is only 1 point
          long. Otherwise it will create a new list of points that sit at the <i>t</i> ratios (i.e.
          the "markers" outlined in the above algorithm), and then call the draw function for this
          new list.</p>

        <p>To see this in action, click the following sketch. This sketch has a curve that can be lowered and elevated,
        and will show de Casteljau's "skeleton" around the curve, showing how it's determining where to draw the curve's
        point for every <i>t</i> value. To pause or resume, simply click or hit space bar (when focussed on the sketch).</p>
